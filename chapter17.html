        <div><h2>William Henry Harrison is elected in 1840</h2>
<p>Harrison wasn't the best of leaders so the following 2 men really led the country
 - Daniel Webster was Harrison's secretary of state
 - Henry Clay was leader of the whig party
Harrison made an hour long speech at his inaugauration in the pouring rain and a month later dies in office
Congress had no idea what to do
 - They decided the VP becomes POTUS
John Tyler was now in office</p>
<h3>Clay vs. Tyler</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clay and Webster wanted to pass a bill that would make the bank under Govt. Jurisdiction but Tyler Vetoed it again</li>
<li>A watered down version of the bank bill was also vetoed by Tyler
Eventually Clay and Webster kicked Tyler out of the Whig party telling him hes not a real whig</li>
</ul>
<h2>Relations with England</h2>
<p>In 1837 the Canadians wanted indepence from England and the US openly supported the candian rebels</p>
<p>The <em>Caroline</em> was a US ship carrying weapons to the Canadians
 - The British stopped and searched the ship and sank</p>
<p>The <em>Creole</em> was a US ship carrying slaves
 - There was a slave rebellion on board and they sailed the ship to british controlled bahamas
 - They were welcomed with open arms adn told they could live as free ppl there</p>
<p>All these 3 events strained the Anglo-American relationship</p>
<p>Skirmishes were starting to break out on the canadian-maine border about where the border line was
Webster and Ash-Burton decided to define the border between Maine and Canada</p>
<h3>Texas</h3>
<p>Mexico and Mexicans still viewed Texas as a part of Mexico
 - Mexico said to the US that if the US annexed or even recognized Texas it would be viewed as an act of war
Texas was making treaties with Holland, Belgium, and France who recognized Texas as an independent country
England realized that acknowledging Texas would weaken the stability of the US </p></div>
