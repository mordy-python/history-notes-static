        <div><h1>Wilmot Proviso</h1>
<p>He proposed to congress that New Mexico, &amp; California should be free
Southerners cried fowl</p>
<h2>Popular Sovereignty</h2>
<ul>
<li>Its the idea that territories should determine whether or not they were slave states or free states</li>
<li>It seemed like a good compromise between Abolitionists and Slave Supporters</li>
</ul>
<p>James K. Polk decided not to run for a second term in 1848
The Democrats nominated Lewis Cask to run for President.
    He supported Popular Sovereignty
This is the last time the Whigs nominated a candidate
<em> The Whigs nominated Zachary Taylor
</em> He was a general who fought in the Mexican American War
<em> He owned slaves
A breakaway party called the Free Soil Party formed.
</em> It was made of Dems and Whigs who liked Pop. Sovereignty but didnt like the candidate
* They were strongly against slavery
    * The Republican party formed out of them</p>
<p>Taylor won the election of 1848
Gold was discovered in 1848 in California
It started the Gold Rush
<em> The miners brought violence
    * They fought and killed to steal other miners gold
</em> And disease
This caused lots of tension
Eventually the miners overran Californias small communities
The Californians decided they wanted to be a state
<em> They petitioned Congress for statehood without becoming a territory first
</em> They drafted a state constitution
    * It clearly banned slavery in California
    * This was revolutionary
* Because of this the Southerners didn't allow it to become a state
    * It was left in limbo just like Texas</p>
<h2>Harriet Tubman</h2>
<ul>
<li>She was an escaped slave</li>
<li>She went back to the south as a spy during the civil war</li>
<li>After the War she helped slaves escape through the Underground RailRoad<ul>
<li>She led them to safe houses and they traveled all the way north to Canada or south to Haiti</li>
</ul>
</li>
