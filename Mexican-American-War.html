        <div><h3>The Mexican American War</h3>
<p>There were'nt a lot of spanish ppl in california so they intermarried with the Californian settlers</p>
<p>James K. Polk wanted to acquire Calif. for the U.S except it belonged to Mexico</p>
<p>Polk sent a representative to Mexico w/ 25 million for California
the Mexicans hated the US so much that they declined.</p>
<p>Polk tried to bait the Mexicans so they would be seen as the aggressor and the US had to defend itself.</p>
<p>Jan 1846:
    Polk ordered Zach Taylor to cross the Rio Grande with 4000 troops into Mexican Territory
    Mexican troops showed up and the 2 armies battled and some Americans were killed
    In May 1846 Polk went to congress and said
    * There were many unpaid claims that mexico owed the US
    * He was angry that the Mexicans refused to meet w/ his representative
    * And finally the Mexicans has American Blood on their hands
    The Mexican American War started in 1846
    Mexico was in no way ready to part with California
    * Both sides were both prepared for war
    * Americans felt Moral Indignation that Mexicans killed Americans
    * Most Americans were pro war
      * They saw Mexico as the agressor
      * Even though it was the US who instigated</p>
<h2>American Generals</h2>
<p>Courney
<em> Traveled to Santa Fe
</em> On the way to Santa Fe he also captured Arizona and New Mexico
Zachary Taylor
<em> Military Genius
</em> He went from Western Texas to central Mexico
Winfield Scott
<em> Was in the Navy
</em> He went by sea and made it to Mexico City
Mexico was totally outmatched</p>
<p>After only 2 years the US came out on top
To add insult to injury the US sent the chief clerk of the State Dept. to make the treaty with Mexico;
not a high ranking official
This went back to the way that Mexico treated Polks Representative
They signed the treaty of Gaudalupe-Hidalgo in 1848
The US bought the land for $15 million
Mexico lost half of its territory
There were Whigs in congress who saw this as a problem
They wanted to know if all the land would be slave land or free land
All the Mexicans who lived in these territories were now all American
This was the war that had the beginings of the anti-war sentiment</p></div>
