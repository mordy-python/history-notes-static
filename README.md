# History Notes
This repo is how my static history notes site is deployed
## Built on Pelican and Python
This works by writing a markdown file then writing
```make publish``` to publish the changes
```git add notes3.markdown``` then commit and pushing to git hub, then opening the repl and running ``git pull``
